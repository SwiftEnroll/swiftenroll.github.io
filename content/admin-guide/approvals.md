## Why this matters
Parents can enroll one or more children. Each child’s request moves through statuses (e.g., Pending → Approved/Waitlisted/Declined). In most setups, payment happens after approval.

## Where to work
- Registration → Enrollment requests (admin list)

## What you’ll see
- Columns include Student, Day of week, Start time, Class (Activity), Rank (#1, #2, #3), Status, Paid, Updated, and Financial aid link.
- Filters for Enrollment period, Day/Time, Status, and Paid (Paid/Not paid).

## Steps
1. Open Registration → Enrollment requests.
2. Filter by Enrollment period and optionally by Day/Time.
3. For rank‑choice periods: sort or filter, then use Rank to prioritize (#1 shown as “#1”).
4. Select requests and choose one of:
   - Action → Set approved
   - Action → Set waitlisted
   - Action → Decline selected
   - Action → Decline and refund (guided flow; see refunds below)
5. To inspect details (including aid): click a request row; related financial aid request will be linked if present.

## Tips & best practices
- Approve in manageable batches to keep communication clear.
- Use Waitlist for oversubscribed classes; revisit if seats open.
- Payment status is visible at a glance; unpaid approved requests can be nudged via email.
