## Why this matters
Enrollment periods control what families see and how they select classes. SwiftEnroll supports both first‑come‑first‑served (FCFS) and rank‑choice selection.

## Steps
1. Go to Registration → Enrollment periods.
2. Click Add or edit an existing period.
3. Set:
   - Name (e.g., “Spring 2026”)
   - Start/End time windows (when families can submit)
   - Selection mode: First‑come‑first‑served or Rank‑choice
   - Any other options your site exposes
4. Save.
5. While open, use the Enrollment periods list to:
   - Action → Export outstanding requests (CSV of requests not finalized)
   - Open a period detail view to see counts by class and status

## Tips & best practices
- FCFS: approvals typically follow the order received; consider capacity thresholds.
- Rank‑choice: students rank classes (Rank #1, #2, #3). Use the Rank column in Enrollment Requests to guide approvals.
- Close the period before running large approval batches to avoid last‑minute changes.
