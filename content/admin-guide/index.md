# SwiftEnroll Admin: From Setup to Daily Operations

SwiftEnroll helps school and program administrators publish classes, manage enrollments, handle approvals and payments (including scholarships), and process refunds — all from a responsive admin dashboard.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have configured your program, created schedules and classes, opened an enrollment period (first‑come‑first‑served or rank‑choice), approved enrollments, collected payments, and handled refunds.
