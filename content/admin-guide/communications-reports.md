## Why this matters
Clear communication keeps families informed, and exports support rosters, carline lists, and reconciliation.

## Quick emails
- From Registration → Classes, select a class → Action → Export parent emails (CSV). Use your email tool to send updates.

## Operational reports
- Registration → Enrollment periods → Action → Export outstanding requests (follow‑ups for incomplete items)
- Registration → Reports (if enabled) for additional exports and summaries
- Financial aid CSV export from the Financial aid list

## Tips & best practices
- Keep a dated folder for CSV exports; include the period name in filenames.
- For last‑minute changes, export emails and send narrow, targeted messages by class.
