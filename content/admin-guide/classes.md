## Why this matters
A Class combines an Activity and a Schedule; this is what parents actually select. You can cancel dates, add makeup days, and email parents from here.

## Steps
1. Go to Registration → Classes.
2. Click Add and choose:
   - Activity
   - Schedule (day/time and dates)
   - Enrollment period
   - Instructor and Location (if used)
3. Save the class.
4. From the class list, you can:
   - Action → Duplicate selected classes
   - Action → Cancel class (opens a confirmation flow)
   - Action → Drop class (remove students)
   - Action → Add class date (e.g., makeup day)
   - Action → Export parent emails
5. To cancel or add a date for a single class, click the class → use the dedicated “Cancel class” or “Add class date” links.

## Tips & best practices
- Use “Export parent emails” for quick announcements or schedule changes.
- For high‑demand programs, watch the Near‑capacity indicator (internally NEAR_MAX_CAPACITY = 90%).
- Cancel vs. Drop: Cancel affects the whole class; Drop removes selected enrollments.
