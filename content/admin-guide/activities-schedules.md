## Why this matters
Activities define what’s taught and for whom; schedules define when. You’ll combine them to create class instances.

## Steps — Activities
1. Go to Registration → Activities.
2. Click Add.
3. Enter Name, Capacity, Minimum capacity, Minimum/Maximum grade, Description, and Special notes.
4. Upload an Image if desired; preview appears automatically (image_preview).
5. Click Save.
6. To reuse an activity: select it in the list, choose Action → Duplicate selected activities, and click Go.

## Steps — Schedules
1. Go to Registration → Schedules.
2. Click Add.
3. Choose the Enrollment period (or create it first in step 4 if not available).
4. Set Day of week, Start/End time, and either:
   - Single date, or
   - A date range (range_start/range_end), or
   - Custom dates list (dates)
5. Click Save.
6. To clone a similar schedule: select entries and run Action → Duplicate schedule.

## Tips & best practices
- Capacity on Activities is used to gauge demand; you can still override per class if needed.
- Name schedules clearly (e.g., “Mon 3–4pm Session A”) so they’re easy to pick later.
