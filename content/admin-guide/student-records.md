## Why this matters
Clean records help you resolve issues quickly — siblings, homerooms, aid history, and payments are all connected.

## Where to work
- Registration → Students

## What you’ll see
- Student list with grade, homeroom, siblings, and a summary of financial aid requests.
- On a student detail page, related parents and requests are easy to navigate.
