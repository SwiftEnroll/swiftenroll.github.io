## Why this matters
Program settings (name, contact info, tax ID) appear on invoices, emails, and reports. Set them up once before publishing classes.

## Steps
1. In the admin dashboard, go to: Registration → Program configurations.
2. Click Add or open your existing configuration.
3. Fill in:
   - Name and Short name
   - Contact email, phone, address
   - Tax ID (appears on receipts/refunds)
4. Click Save.

## Tips & best practices
- Use a shared inbox (e.g., programs@yourdomain.org) for Contact email so replies reach your whole team.
- Short name is used in some exports and headings — keep it concise (e.g., “AfterSchool 2025”).
